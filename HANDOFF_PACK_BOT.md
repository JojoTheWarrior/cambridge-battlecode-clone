# Handoff: the from-scratch "pack" bot (written 2026-11-03, ~12:30Z)

Read this first, then `NIRVAN_CLAUDE.md` (the full history of the baseline bot, v110 to v125, with the
judgement table of every lever tried). The memory directory
`C:\Users\joshu\.claude\projects\c--Users-joshu-Desktop-VSCode-Projects-cambridge-battlecode\memory\`
holds the user's standing rules; `MEMORY.md` there is the index.

## Where things stand

- **Ladder:** v119 of `bots/baseline` is live and recommended (pocket entries over holes). Every later
  version (v120-v125) lost its practice block against v119 and was not kept. Rating is far below the
  user's 2200 goal; the user asked, last, to **start over with a new bot** and gave full permission to
  submit/activate on the ladder ("i give you full perms to alter the ladder or whatever you want").
- **The new bot lives in `bots/pack/src`** (main.cpp, draft.cpp, bot.h, bot.cpp). It builds
  (`cambc build bots/pack --release`). It is **not yet playable**: in its first full game on
  `00packs` against `bots/baseline` it scored 0 gems, 21 deaths, 240 monster damage total, while
  the baseline won at round 841 with 1024 gems. The cause is not yet found (see "Debug state").
- Working tree: `bots/baseline` is clean at HEAD (v119 + closed knobs). `bots/pack` is new and
  **uncommitted**. Commit it (the user wants GitHub pushes, clean: no raw data, no replays).

## User rules (from the whole session; follow them)

- Practice groups on the same maps, seats and opponents in the same hour are the judge. Local games
  against test-bot/stacker/baseline are noise except as mechanism checks (a bot that scores 0 gems
  locally is broken; a bot that wins 55/100 locally has proven nothing).
- The user allows practice games at will and submit/activate at will. Quota: 50 practice matches
  per hour (10 groups of 5). Each practice pair exposes the ladder for ~25 rating; keep v119 live
  while testing, i.e. submit, activate the test version, run groups, re-activate v119
  (`analysis/pg10/test_v119.sh` and `test_v12x.sh` show the mk/waitlive/waitquota pattern).
- Push to GitHub, keep it clean. Document findings in `NIRVAN_CLAUDE.md` (its judgement table).
- The user is asleep (EST). Machine local time is EST; platform timestamps are UTC (`date -u`).
- Specialists per map class are fine (route at round 1); the user said "go ham".

## Tooling

- `cambc build bots/<name> --release`; `cambc run bots/pack bots/baseline --map 00packs --release
  -o <dir> --rounds N --statistics <dir>/stats.json --json`. Never run two `cambc run` of the same
  bot concurrently before one build has finished (cmake races).
- Replay bundle `.repl26a` is a zip: `replay.repl26a`, `team-a.stdout` (NUL-padded; read with
  `tr -d '\000'`), `team-a.fuel`. `stats.json` has per-champion metrics (monsterDamageDone,
  championDamageTaken, deaths, earnedGold...) and `roster`.
- `python scripts/evaluate.py --bot pack --baseline baseline,stacker,test-bot --maps 01big-world,...
  --fuels 100000 --out <dir>` plays every map in both seats (configs are for `strategy.h` knobs of the
  baseline; for `pack` use the default config `current`).
- Map names: `maps/eval/*.map26a` (e.g. `00packs`, `01big-world`, `02the-pond`, `03reef`).
- Analysis scripts: `scripts/analysis/rounds.mjs, layout.mjs, mapgrid.mjs (print offset +4,+1 vs bot
  coords), camphp.mjs`; `analysis/pg10/*.py` (gamesum, goldsrc, capseq, deathquality, packshare).
- Ladder: `cambc submit bots/pack -n "<=80 chars"`, `cambc submissions activate vN` (switch takes up
  to ~10 min), `cambc match-groups create/show`, `cambc ladder --page N`, `cambc matches list --team X
  --kind ranked --limit 100`.
- Heredoc caveat: `\n` inside a bash heredoc becomes a real newline. Write scripts and C++ with the
  Write tool or a `.py` patch file, not inline heredocs.

## SDK facts learned the hard way (sdk/cpp/cambc.h, imports.h)

- `bitboard::copy_from` is private: use assignment `a = b`. `a |= b`, `a &= ~b` work in place; each
  op and each `bitboard()` constructor costs fuel (engine calls/SIMD in wasm).
- `distance_field::compute(walls, roots, visited, max)` and `compute_to(...)` are **wasm-side BFS**
  (fuel proportional to tiles). Measured on 00packs (31x31): a full-map compute ≈ 3k fuel,
  the whole turn ≈ 40k of the 100k budget. First play turn has 2x fuel but `initialise()` cost 150k
  (camp_groups(), per-group bitboards, home field) so round 1 overruns into round 2; acceptable.
- `camp_group::state()` throws when no camp of the group is in vision; use the raw
  `bc::detail::sdk_camp_group_state(handle, &state)` (1 alive, 2 reward available, 3 respawning,
  0 unknown) and `sdk_camp_group_cooldown` for the timer, only for groups with a spawn tile visible.
- Ally positions are **not** known out of vision (vision is per champion). `sdk_champion(handle,
  &info)` returns api_not_in_vision (97) or x,y < 0 for hidden champions, allies included. Team
  coordination must go through the 8-byte shared memory (`bc::shared_memory.read/write(0,
  std::span{&pod,1})`).
- Raw structs: `detail::champion_info {team,type,x,y,health,max_health,strength,focus,move_speed,
  attack_range,state}` (state bits: alive 1<<0, recalling 1<<1, submitting 1<<2, can_move 1<<3,
  can_attack 1<<4, can_cast 1<<11, teleporting 1<<12); `detail::camp_state {x,y,health,max_health,
  strength,focus,cooldowns[2]}` via `sdk_camp(handle,&state)`.
- `champion_stats {vision_radius, base_move_speed, base_attack_range, base_health, health_growth,
  base_strength, strength_growth, base_focus, focus_growth, camp_damage_multiplier}`.
- Items: `item_type::<family>_shard_of_<stat>` (families monster, power, durability, treasure,
  jungle, home, bruiser, tribute, capture, prospector, hunter, skirmish, greed, collectors);
  `item.cost()` (30), `item.result()` (the emblem), `item.passive()`, `item.passive_magnitude()`,
  `me.item_count()[item]`, `me.can_buy(item,1)`, `me.buy(item,1)`. Buying is only on spawn or dead.
- Abilities: `me.abilities()` (2 slots), `a.info()` optional variant (ability_damage{range,modifier},
  ability_cc, ability_aoe_damage{range,modifier,radius}, ability_dash{range}, ability_shield,
  ability_attack_reset), each with `exclusive_with_movement`; `a.cooldown()`, `a.use()`, `a.use(vec2)`,
  `a.use(camp)`, `a.use(champion)`, `a.valid_tiles()` (legal dash landings), `a.is_dash()` etc.
- Draft: `bc::draft::team_size()`, `current_draft(team)`, `pick(champion_draft)`. Draft enum:
  ryth 0, vesper_vale 1, vendetta 2, cassi_and_issac 3, stellar 4, prism 5, marcella 6, willow 7,
  ren 8, varg 9, tavi 10, heart_of_ruin 11. champion_type enum differs (cassi 3, issac 4, ...,
  varg 10, tavi 11, heart_of_ruin 12).
- Engine error 42 "Target must be a visible enemy or neutral camp" came up twice a game in the pack
  bot (an attack on a camp read as alive that was not targetable; guard with `visible.is_set`).
- `move_towards` is also SDK-side BFS (builds a blocked board each call). `me.move(delta)`,
  `me.move_absolute(tile)` return false on a newly revealed obstruction, throw on known-blocked.

## Game facts that matter for design (docs/GameRules.md)

Wolf 1350hp/20str/r3 (40g, 4 gems, respawn 40), elk 2400/60/r4 (90g, 15 gems, 60), golem
5000/120/r4 (160g, 36 gems, 80), gem cluster 120hp (7 gems, 50), gold cluster 120hp (20g, 50),
monolith 20000/200/r5 (300g, 200 gems, 150). Camps hit only the nearest champion, wake on damage,
sleep after 2 rounds with nobody in range, never heal. Capture: stand on a dead group's spawn tile
5 rounds (Capture emblem: 3), reward split among allies on the tiles. Tribute within Chebyshev 1 of
an altar, ceil(gems/10) turn ends, damage does not interrupt (stun, death, new lock do). Recall 5
turn ends (3 with Home), cancelled by damage/stun. Death: killer gets the bag + 100 gold, 60-round
respawn, camp kills destroy the bag. Ranged (range 3) cannot move and attack in one turn; melee
can. Dashes: ground within 2 tiles, cross holes not walls. Shards 30 gold, 5 = emblem. Fuel 100k a
turn (2x first play turn, 100x first draft turn). Vision 8, not shared with allies; one ward each.

## The pack bot's design (bots/pack/src)

- `draft.cpp`: fixed roster by team size: vendetta, heart_of_ruin, vesper_vale, marcella, varg.
- `bot.h`: `Group` (spawn tiles, edges = walkable tiles beside them, gems/gold, health_total,
  strength_sum/max, status alive/reward/cooling with predicted respawn when unseen, enemy_seen,
  unsafe_until, unreachable_until), `Unit` (raw champion read), `CampSeen` (camps of alive groups in
  view within 10 tiles, with awake flag from `vision::awake_camp_tiles`), `Shared` (6 claim bytes:
  group index+1, 0x80 = not farming; enemy_group/enemy_round).
- `bot.cpp` turn order: dead → shop; channeling → wait; at spawn → shop; stuck 8 turns → mark the
  group unreachable; `fight()` (engage when local health×damage ≥ 1.15× theirs, 1.8× with a bag ≥ 40;
  focus the weakest in range; abilities; else step away toward home); `survive()` (under 30% health:
  flee enemies, step out of camp range, else recall; two camp turns would leave < 20%: step out);
  `bank()` (nearest altar by field; trip when bag ≥ 40, or ≥ 10 within 2 steps or on spawn, win,
  deadline; enemy locks are attacked); recall to shop at 300 gold with an empty bag;
  `choose_target()` (value = reward/(claimers+1)/(walk + clear + capture), pack bonus 1.3 on rich
  groups, 0.5 crowding on small ones, enemy-sighting penalty, golem/monolith guards, 1.25 stickiness,
  jump routes via a holes-passable field for dash champions); `farm()` (hold reward tiles, wait by
  cooling groups, attack the lowest-health camp in range, attack resets, damage/aoe/cc abilities on
  camps, Heart of Ruin dash landing beside 2+ camps, shield when camps are on us); `place_ward()`.
- Navigation: per turn one field `reach` rooted at me over `blocked` (terrain | alive group spawn
  tiles | visible champions | teleport reservations), a `reach_jump` variant with holes passable for
  dash champions; movement by a `goal` field rooted at the destination tiles and
  `next_move_from(pos)`; `dash_toward()` picks the landing among `valid_tiles()` with the smallest
  jump-field value when the next step is a hole.

## Debug state (what to do next)

Latest result (12:55Z, after raising the engage margin to 1.6x, a 90-round enemy memory, an
enemy-half penalty before round 400, a separate `goal_jump` field and a visibility guard in
`attack_camp`): still **0 gems** on 00packs (21 deaths) and **0 gems on 01big-world with only 3
deaths** against the baseline. So the bot is not farming at all even when it is not dying: the
fault is in farm()/attack_camp()/observe_groups(), not in the fight model. Add TURN-level prints of
`camps.size()`, the target's status and `walk_to_group`, and whether `attack_camp` finds a focus.

1. `bot.cpp` currently has `debug = true` and `probe()` fuel prints (FUEL start/pre-reach/reach/
   observed/pre-goal/goal/end, TURN lines). Set `debug = false` before any submit.
2. Fuel is fine after round 1 (≈40k a turn on 00packs). The 60-round debug game shows the three
   champions walking toward target group 2/3 from spawn. The full game had 0 gems and 21 deaths with
   8.7k champion damage taken per body: they are reaching camps but barely attacking (240 monster
   damage in 841 rounds) and dying to the enemy champions. Suspects, in order: (a) `attack_camp()`
   never finds a `CampSeen` for the target (the `camps` list is only filled for groups whose raw
   state is 1 and within 10 tiles; check `c.group != int(&g - groups.data())` and that `read_camp`
   succeeds for camps in view); (b) `farm()` marks groups unsafe (`safe_to_clear`) and the champions
   wander; (c) `fight()` engages the baseline's 3-stack and loses; (d) `go()` reuses `visible` as the
   BFS scratch board and then refreshes it, but `reach_jump` is also reused as the jump goal field
   and `reach_jump_ok` flips false, so later `jump_to_group` reads a stale field in the same turn.
   Run `--rounds 200` with debug on, grep TURN/TARGET/FIGHT lines, and watch gems/hp per round.
3. When it farms: judge locally against `bots/baseline` on 6-8 maps both seats (`evaluate.py
   --bot pack --baseline baseline`), then the practice block (same maps/seats/opponents as a v119
   reference block in the same hour, see `analysis/pg10/test_v119.sh`), then activate if it wins.
4. Ideas not yet in the bot: TP crystals (10 gold, 3 tiles, 3-turn channel) for walled centres
   (quadrants); altar locks (10 gold) on the enemy's home altar; Capture emblem on one farmer; using
   `set_priority` so finishing blows act first; Cassi&Issac roster (every top team drafts it).

## What the baseline taught (so the new bot does not repeat it)

Every tuning lever on the baseline (packs at the clear, twin roster, chains of dashes, health
builds, death-site penalties, bank bag size, cohesion, gold value, first-turn fit, Varg roster)
measured flat or negative in practice. The single kept gain of 2026-11-03 was pocket entries over
holes (v119). The open gap is the fight class: our champions farm cheaper groups and lose the first
team fight. The top teams (Mite, Intercontinental Fish, Ad Astra) draft Cassi&Issac plus Vesper,
Vendetta, Heart of Ruin, Marcella, Varg, Prism or Willow, clear rich groups in packs of 2-3,
bank bags of ~47 gems 29 times a game, and win fights with numbers. Compare their ranked replays
(`analysis/pg10/fetch.sh`, `capseq.py`, `gamesum.py`) on our worst maps before guessing.
